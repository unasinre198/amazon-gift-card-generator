## What is an American Express Gift Card?

American Express gift cards are prepaid cards that can be used wherever American Express is accepted. They can be purchased at various retailers and online, making them a versatile gift option. Unlike regular credit cards, they have a set value, and once the balance is depleted, the card cannot be used again.

### Benefits of Using American Express Gift Cards

- **No Credit Check:** Thereâ€™s no need for a credit check, making them accessible to everyone.
- **Budget Control:** Since they are prepaid, you can only spend the amount loaded onto the card.
- **Widely Accepted:** American Express is accepted at millions of locations, including Amazon.
