## What is an Amazon Gift Card?

An Amazon gift card is a prepaid card that you can use to purchase items on Amazon's platform. They come in various denominations, and you can redeem them for products, services, or digital items like ebooks, music, and apps.

Gift cards can be physical (mailed to you) or digital (emailed directly). When you receive a gift card, youâ€™ll get a unique code, which you can enter at checkout to apply the balance to your purchase.

#### 1. **Online Surveys and Research Studies**

One of the easiest ways to earn a $100 Amazon gift card is by participating in online surveys. Many market research companies offer compensation in the form of gift cards for your time and feedback. While it may take some time to accumulate points, completing surveys can be a relatively low-effort way to earn gift cards.

#### 2. **Cashback and Rewards Apps**

Another great way to earn a $100 Amazon gift card is through cashback and rewards apps. These apps give you cashback or points for making purchases from specific retailers or brands. Once you've accumulated enough points, you can exchange them for Amazon gift cards.

**Popular Cashback Apps:**

- Rakuten (formerly Ebates)
- Dosh
- Ibotta
- Fetch Rewards
- Shopkick

With these apps, you can earn cashback on your everyday purchases. As you accumulate cashback, you can redeem it for Amazon gift cards. While the process of earning cashback can take some time, if you shop frequently, youâ€™ll be able to reach $100 relatively quickly.

#### 3. **Online Shopping Programs**

If you already shop online regularly, why not take advantage of programs that reward you for your purchases? Some programs partner with Amazon and offer rewards that you can redeem for gift cards.

**Popular Programs:**

- Amazon's own "Amazon Rewards Visa Card"
- Capital One Shopping
- Honey Gold
- ShopAtHome

These programs are designed to help you save money on items you would already be purchasing. With some programs, you can even receive bonus points or cashback that can be converted to Amazon gift cards.

#### 4. **Referral Programs**

Many apps and websites offer referral programs that reward you when you invite others to join the platform. These referral programs often offer bonuses, including Amazon gift cards, once your referred friend makes a qualifying purchase or completes specific tasks.

**Popular Referral Programs:**

- Rakuten
- Swagbucks
- Ibotta
- Refer-A-Friend programs on shopping sites

If youâ€™re able to refer a few friends, the bonuses from these programs can quickly add up to a $100 Amazon gift card. Be sure to check the referral terms, as some platforms offer higher rewards for more referrals.

#### 5. **Play Games and Win Gift Cards**

If you enjoy playing mobile games or casual online games, you can use some of your free time to play for Amazon gift cards. Certain gaming apps and websites offer gift cards as rewards for completing in-game challenges or reaching specific milestones.
